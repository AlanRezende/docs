Team members who consistently invest their time into our
projects can expect to be rewarded occasionally. We don't
indulge the team, but do show appreciation for repeatedly
choosing open source contributions over alternative obligations
or opportunities.

We are transparent about these rewards. A selection of rewards
we might offer to valuable team members and outside contributors:

- **Paying for development time.**
_This is the default method for making our projects sustainable.
It is literally paying someone for time spent on this project instead
of for instance client work. Developers are often paid for large
time investments on their end._
- **Merchandise.**
_Like a unique Tenancy t-shirt or stickers._
- **Greeting or gift card.**
_Just a spontaneous minor thank you or for a birthday._
- **Conference tickets.**
_Aside from making a perfect moment for a get together, allowing team members
to visit conferences allows them to market our projects and grow their
knowledge._

These awards are introduced to guarantee continued development of the Tenancy projects.
Costs involved are withdrawn from our [Open Collective](donations) where expenses are
visible to the public.
