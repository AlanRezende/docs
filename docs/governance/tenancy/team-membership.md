All our team members have contributed in one way or another consistently.
Standing out like that made them pop up on our radar. Nevertheless if you
can give us a reason for your membership we'll obviously consider it.

Team membership does not give you a higher rank and even though we do
[reward](reward-system) outstanding contributions, these are not guaranteed.
Choosing to become a team member is more about the willingness to support
our [cause](strategy).
